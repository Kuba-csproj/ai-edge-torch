Gemma3n-hf is probably the highest quality source of data you can find in the references. It contains working code from the huggingface-transformers Github repo.

Gemma3n-configs are reference data from the official model files.

generic-research.txt is a research conducted by other AI model. More details are in the file. However, it is good for general knowledge. I would not recommend trusting the specifics and details.
